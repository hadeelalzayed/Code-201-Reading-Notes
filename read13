The past, present and future of local storage for web applications:-
the  operating system provides an abstraction layer for storing the getting applications data. Values could be stored in the registry, ini files, xml files or some other place.-
User data allows web pages to store up to 64kb of data per domain. This was during the internet explorer which was the first web browser that everyone knew. 
There are many other webpages that came out during the era and many of them failed.HTML5 Storage is a specific name for Web Storage. Back in time, it was part of the HTML5 itself,
then leading to a split due to political reasons. There are other names/types for storage, such as DOM Storage or Local Storage.
HTML5 Storage are a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser.You can access the HTML5 Storage from your JavaScript through local
Storage object on the global window object, but will need to check whether the browser supports it.
So what is HTML5 Storage? Simply put, it’s a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser.
Like cookies, this data persists even after you navigate away from the web site, close your browser tab, exit your browser, or what have you. Unlike cookies, 
this data is never transmitted to the remote web server (unless you go out of your way to send it manually). Unlike all previous attempts at providing persistent local storage, 
it is implemented natively in web browsers, so it is available even when third-party browser plugins are not.

Which browsers? Well, the latest version of pretty much every browser supports HTML5 Storage… even Internet Explorer!
