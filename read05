### Storing Images onYour Site
If you are building a site from scratch, it is good practice to create a folder for all of the images the site uses.
**Adding Images :** by tag <img> , src This tells the browser where it can find the image file  , alt provides a text description of the image and title to provide additional information about the image .
**heigt and width** to specify the image size in pixels .
we use **align** attribute  to indicate how the other parts of a page should flow around an image.
**Three Rules for Creating Images**

# COLOR

### Foreground Color
The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element.
#### there is 3 ways to specify the color :
1. rgb values
1. hex codes
1. color names

### background color
It means how the color shows in box .

### Contrast
When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough **contrast** for the text to be legible.
 > low , high and medium contrast
If text is reversed out (a light color on a dark background), you can increase the height between lines and the weight of the font to make it easier to read.
