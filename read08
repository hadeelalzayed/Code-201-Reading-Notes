Links are the defining feature of the web, because they let you move from one page to another. You usually use links for the following:

There are several ways to use links on HTML:

- **Linking to other sites** by < a href="url" >

*Linking to other pages on the same site** by adding the url to the page inside the href

**Linking to a specific part of the same page** etc

When websites are large, it is preferable to organize your code by placing the pages of different sections into a new folder (structure - relationships - homepages)
<a> Links are created using the element which has an attribute called href. The value of the href attribute is the page that you want people to go to when they click on the link.

Absolute URL When you link to a different website, the value of the href attribute will be the full web address for the site.

Relative URL When you are linking to other pages within the same site.
