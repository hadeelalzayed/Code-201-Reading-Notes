What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team
The technology industry is not just one of the fastest growing parts of our economy; it is also increasingly the world’s dominant commercial culture.
And at the core of Silicon Valley are certain self-mythologies and dictums: Everything is different now, data reigns supreme, 
today’s winners deserve to triumph because they are cleareyed enough to discard yesterday’s conventional wisdoms and search out the disruptive and the new.
The paradox, of course, is that Google’s intense data collection and number crunching have led it to the same conclusions that good managers have always known. 
In the best teams, members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs.The fact that these insights aren’t wholly original doesn’t mean Google’s contributions
aren’t valuable. In fact, in some ways, the ‘‘employee performance optimization’’ movement has given us a method for talking about our insecurities, 
fears and aspirations in more constructive ways. It also has given us the tools to quickly teach lessons that once took managers decades to absorb.
Google, in other words, in its race to build the perfect team, 
has perhaps unintentionally demonstrated the usefulness of imperfection and done what Silicon Valley does best: figure out how to create psychological safety faster, 
better and in more productive ways.‘Project Aristotle is a reminder that when companies try to optimize everything, 
it’s sometimes easy to forget that success is often built on experiences — like emotional interactions and complicated conversations and discussions of who we want to be 
and how our teammates make us feel 
— that can’t really be optimized.
