Forms are easier to use if the form controls are vertically aligned using CSS.

Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more interactive.

HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements. When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.

By Event Handling

Select the element node(s) you want the script to respond to.

Indicate which event on the selected node(s) will trigger the response.

State the code you want to run when the event occurs.

 (Links to an external site.)The Event Object
When an event occurs, the event object tells you information about the event, and the element it happened upon.

 (Links to an external site.)Kye points
Events are the browser's way of indicating when something has happened.

Binding is the process of stating which event users are waiting to happen, and which element users are waiting for that event to happen upon.

When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a JavaScript function. When this function then changes the web page in some way, it feels interactive because it has responded to the user.

Event delegation are used to monitor for events that happen on all of the children of an element.

The most commonly used events are W3C DOM events.
